## ip dashboard.png
Mailing requires a lot of IP Addresses and managing all the addresses takes a full dashboard.  Each IP line can also
display which domains the IP range delivers to (including the percentage of IPs that can deliver).

## list dashboard.png
Data is imported via a file or ftp.  Once loaded, a list can be dynamically created using parameters such as source, country,
event, and domain.  The list can be sent to the MX servers.  As users open and click on the emails, the list is automatically
updated.

Lists can be grouped by domain for top tier domains (Hotmail, AOL, Gmail, Yahoo) or they can be grouped GI - General Internet.

## report dashboard.png
This screenshot is from one of the smaller mail setups.  But you can see that it easily sends out over 18 million emails
every single day.  The unique way that I handle IP addresses and domains allows the IPs to stay fresh and remain unblocked.

## update application.png
Rad is composed of many components running on several servers.  In order to keep everything up to date when new code is
released, users can use this update dashboard.  It can update the local admin site (and api backend) as well as connect to
each remote mailer and issue a command to have it update its codebase as well.
