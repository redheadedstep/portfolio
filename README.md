## Portfolio

As a Full Stack Developer with extensive experience, there are a lot of projects that I have worked on.  Most of these
projects were done completely by myself or I lead the team as the project architect. I have the mindset that in order
to be a great developer, you can't limit yourself.  If your project requires javascript, you learn javascript.  If your
project requires graphics, you learn how to use a graphic editor.  If your project requires SSL on a remote server with
frontend caching, then you learn how to generate a CSR, load Apache and install Linux.

## Mojavi Framework

The Mojavi Framework was originally designed when PHP 5.0 was first released.  It was a PHP port of the then popular
Java Struts Framework (which was later acquired by the Apache Foundation and is now Apache Struts 2).  It is a very
lightweight MVC framework that supports abstracted database connection pooling, requests, controllers, and views.

It was missing several components that I have added over time such as:
- Logging
- Models
- Forms
- MongoDB Support
- Database Result Resources
- CLI Controllers
- Updated Autoloader (for Composer support)
- REST Controllers
